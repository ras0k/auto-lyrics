## 🔥Auto-Lyrics version #5 - FULLY WORKING AS OF APRIL 20th 2023🔥

In v5, we have successfully integrated a functional webapp, combining the power of yt-dlp (youtube-downloader) and whisper-cTranslate2 (faster-whisper) for an enhanced user experience. 🎶💻

### Auto-Lyrics version #4 - PREPARING FOR A SECURE FUTURE 👀

In v4, we proposed the concept of employing a very simple SHA hashing algorithm to securely encode and compress lyrics. This would save space on ChatGPT-4 and maintain privacy. Although not implemented in v4 or v5, this idea will be revisited if necessary in the future. 🔒

### Faster-Whisper Audio Transcription v3 🚀

In the upcoming v3 of the Auto-Lyrics project, we are planning to include the following improvements:

🛠️ Bug fixes: We'll address all reported bugs from v2 to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience.

🎛️ Faster-Whisper: We will update and stabilize the WhisperX integration by providing access to faster-whisper (whisper-ctranslate2 on pip) which will speed up the proccess and demand less RAM.

Stay tuned for the v3 release, which will offer a more robust and reliable Whisper-cTranslate2 experience. 📈

#### ⚠️ WARNING: v2 BUGGED - Users have reported several bugs in v2, which can cause unexpected errors or performance issues. Please be aware that we are working to resolve these problems as quickly as possible. A new version, v3, will be released to fix these issues once WhisperX is updated and stabilized. Stay tuned for the upcoming release, and thank you for your patience! ⚠️

In v2 of the Auto-Lyrics project, we've made the following enhancements:

🎵 YouTube URL input: Added support for downloading mp3 files from YouTube URLs using the youtube_dl library. Just input a YouTube URL and let the notebook handle the rest!

🌐 Gradio Interface: Implemented a user-friendly Gradio interface, allowing easy input of YouTube URLs, transcription model selection (large or small), and language choice (or leave empty for auto-detect) for transcription.

These updates make the Audio Transcription project more versatile, interactive, and user-friendly, streamlining the process of transcribing audio from YouTube videos. 🎉
